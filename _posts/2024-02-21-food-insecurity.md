title: SNAP Enrollment in Chicago
lead: A dashboard to explore SNAP enrollment trends in Chicago
---

Currently, I am in the process of developing a Shiny dashboard to explore how SNAP enrollment varies across Chicago and how national level predictors of enrollment apply within the city.
<br/><br/>
The first draft can be found <a href = "https://amelmer.shinyapps.io/snap_enrollment/">here!</a>
<br/>
The GitHub repo will be made public in the next few weeks!
