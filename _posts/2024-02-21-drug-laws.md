title: Drug Paraphernalia & Drug Overdose Rates
lead: A dashboard to explore the relationship between drug paraphernalia laws and drug overdose rates
---

Currently, I am in the process of developing a Shiny dashboard to explore how drug paraphernalia laws and drug overdose rates vary by state and overtime and the relationship between the two.
<br/><br/>
A rough first draft of the dashboard can be found <a href="https://amelmer.shinyapps.io/drug_laws_dashboard/" target="_blank">here</a>!
<br/><br/>
Overall the story that this dashboard currently tells is that while legalizing drug paraphernalia is an important step to take in addressing this crisis, it is not a quick fix. States like Alaska, where drug paraphernalia has never been criminalized, are still seeing large increases in their overdose fatality rates. Next steps for research around this topic would be to perform a similar exploratory analysis on the connection between these laws and rates of HIV and hepatitis C and the connection between the number of sites distributing drug checking equipment and needles/syringes in a state and the fatality overdose rates. I would also like to explore the connection between these laws and non-fatal overdose rates. Likely a key factor in reducing the number of overdoses (fatal and non-fatal) is not just the legality of this equipment but how easily accessible it is to those that could benefit from it.
