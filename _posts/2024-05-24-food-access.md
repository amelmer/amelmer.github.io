title: Food Access in San Jose, CA
lead: A map to explore food access throughout the city of San Jose
---

I have just finished developing a first draft of web map that allows the user to measure food access throughout the city of San Jose using two measures, travel range and time of day.
<br/><br/>
The map can be found <a href="https://amelmer.github.io/web-mapping/final-project" target="_blank">here</a>!
<br/><br/>
Some next steps I plan to take with the project are to add a form for users to submit additional food options that are not currently on the map or additional information about locations that are currently on map.
