# About

I just graduated with honors with a Master of Public Policy degree from the Univeristy of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy where I focused on data analytics, social policy, and program evaluation. Previously, I attended the University of California, San Diego where I graduated Summa Cum Laude with Bachelors degrees in Public Policy and Sociolinguistics. 

I have a strong interest in utilizing data to ensure that implemented programs are best serving their intended communities, and I have a variety of experiences working in the areas of food insecurity, housing, and criminal justice.
