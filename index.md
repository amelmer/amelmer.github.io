# About

Currently, I am a second-year Master of Public Policy Candidate at the Univeristy of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy where she is focusing on data analytics, social policy, and program evaluation. Previously, I attended the University of California, San Diego where she graduated Summa Cum Laude with Bachelors degrees in Public Policy and Sociolinguistics. 

I have a strong interest in utilizing data to ensure that implemented programs are best serving their intended demographics, and I have a variety of experiences working in the areas of food insecurity, housing, and criminal justice.
